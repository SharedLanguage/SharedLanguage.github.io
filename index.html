      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
    Since the beginning of the war, approximately <b>120,000</b>
    people have lost their entry permits to Israel, and thus their
    ability to support their families. The goal of our project,
    <b>Shared Language</b>, is to enable those people to earn a
    living, while at the same time giving Israelis the opportunity to
    converse with West Bank residents and learn or improve their
    spoken Arabic. We offer a platform where you can find a spoken
    Arabic teacher from the West Bank. The program is suitable for all
    levels – from complete beginners to advanced learners. We are
    aware that the market is flooded with frameworks for learning
    spoken Arabic, but we believe that those of you who are interested
    in helping will choose us – as an accessible and relatively
    inexpensive option, which also combines a humanitarian goal.
